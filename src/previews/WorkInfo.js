    "Cat Finder is an adventure game with the objective of offering users a refuge from the stress of everyday life. Modelled from scratch in Blender and programmed in Unity, the game can be played on PC or in VR!",
    "I was challenged to code an IDE for document-based networks using TypeScript, React, and SCSS. I used this challenge as an opportunity to propose some suggestions for a hypothetical redesign of the existing web app.",
    "Soma is an app which allows users to track and monitor chronic pain. I coded responsive components and offered design suggestions that would facilitate user navigation.",
    "I created a game which allows users to track their productivity and earn pets in exchange. The goal of the game is to offer users an incentive to study! This was my first independent programming project.",
    "A design for the pilot website of Boston AI Labs: a startup company that designs AI technology to detect and combat Retinopathy of Prematurity in newborn infants.",
    "I architected and executed responsive web solutions, and also redesigned existing web pages with mindfulness of UX principles. I also conducted user testing.",
    "I created a ray tracer which parses tree-based scene representations, projects a ray to calculate intersection points, and uses a Phong lighting model to color each pixel of an image."
