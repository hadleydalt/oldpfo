    "For this assignment, I was asked to study an object and draw it repeatedly to create a rhythmic composition. I chose a shell. ",
    "In this piece, I chose to showcase various representations of triumph across historical, artistic, and contemporary contexts.",
    "My challenge was to be more open and fluid in my work, developing my technique from previous paintings. This painting articulates confusion.",
    "I collected a series of digital and fine artworks exhibiting subjects whose insides are depicted or imagined in an unorthodox way.",
    "A painting born out of spontaneous decisions and many failed attempts. This painting is a celebration of sponaneity, impulsivity, and failure.",
    "In painting this image, which references a photograph, I attempted to develop my illustrative skills and bring colorful vibrancy to a scene.",
    "With this dress I represent ideas such as beauty, purity, and even marriage in a fragile, transient, paper form.",
    "This is a surrealist piece in which I sought to create a dreamlike atmosphere, drawing inspiration from surrealist and fauvist masters.",
    "Each face, cast below the surface of the water, represents an emotion I am not allowing myself to feel.",
    "This assignment is an exercise in creating the illusion of transparency.",
    "In this series of collages I showcase aspects of Kowloon Walled City, including its overpopulation and eventual demolition at the hands of the Hong Kong government."
