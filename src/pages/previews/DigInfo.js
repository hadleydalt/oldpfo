    "This is an imaginary environment that draws influence from renaissance and baroque architecture and paintings.",
    "An imagined scene of a restaurant underwater. I drew influence from dystopian scenes from Blade Runner and similar films, and of course, from surrealist work.",
    "A practice in perspective. The scenario is fantastical and nonsensical, with the assignment's only requirement being the inclusion of a the pedestal object in the bottom left. ",
    "I thought about the passage of time which will one day submerge New York City underwater due to climate change. Hopefully we can stall this process and preserve my favorite city.",
    "This painting is a reminder to never give up! I created a scene to depict the feeling of finding oneself after being lost. The color scheme is chromatic, saturated and ethereal.",
    "Deja-vu refers to something we've already seen. What are we seeing twice in this painting?",
    "I referenced a photograph and added a stylized context!",
    "In this painting I practiced my digital painting skills by creating a portrait of Bella Hadid on a horse. The title refers to a well-known meme about the model.",
    "I was commissioned to illustrate some quotes comparing the West to Asia in the style of cartoonist Saul Steinberg. In each illustration, the leftmost image depicts the West while the rightmost depicts Asia.",
    "I am trapped in quarantine and the internet has become the world. I wanted to imagine the feeling of being caged while also depicting the sensationalized version of the world that I experience through the internet."
